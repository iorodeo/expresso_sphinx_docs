The expresso sensor system is designed for performing automated, realtime,
multi-channel fly capillary feeding assays.  The expresso sensor bank consists
of five independent feeding channels. Each feeding channel has its
own glass feeding capillary which sits along a linear array optical sensor.  A
micro-controller samples the data from the optical sensor and  detects the
liquid food level in the capillary. Custom data acquisition software records
the time vs liquid level for one or more sensor banks.
